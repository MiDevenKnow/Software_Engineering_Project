# COMP2140 - SOFTWARE ENGINEERING PROJECT

  ● An interactive web application created to carry out the functionalities of Mama B's Groceries.

# Client Issues

  ● Miss Diana Brown is faced with inconsistency with record keeping as items flow in and out of the 
    business paired with poor calculation of revenues and expenses which led to the wastage of food and money. 

  ● A manual record keeping system which causes inconsistency in the accounting records of the business's revenue and expenditure.
  
  ● The use of a periodic inventory system in which she occasionally does physical count to measure the level of inventory and the cost of goods sold. 
  
   As a result Miss Brown does not know her stock levels, has a lack of details of her flow of income, potentially losing revenue, 
   and is not collecting useful sales information.
